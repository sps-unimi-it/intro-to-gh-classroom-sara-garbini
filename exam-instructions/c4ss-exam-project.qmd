# Exam project

---

## Type: a replication study

We often read of data-driven Social science analyses

Let's replicate such studies with our own coding

and, possibly, use it as a base for further discoveries

---

## Topic:

Can you convincingly replicate the findings of

Chan et al., *Four best practices for measuring news sentiment using ‘off-the-shelf’ dictionaries: a large-scale p-hacking experiment*

[Comp. Communication Res., 2021](https://journal.computationalcommunication.org/article/view/4731)

code is available at [github.com/chainsawriot/ots](https://github.com/chainsawriot/ots)

N.B. not all findings need replication: precise instructions will follow

Operations will be on GitHub: [sps-unimi-it-c4css-2025-26]()


---

## Evaluation metrics:

- correctness (syntactical & semantical)

- code quality: is it clear? Is it easy to reuse/maintain?

- presentation: graphics etc.
  
- veracity: can the student explain their code line-by-line?


# How to: GitHub Classroom


---

## Git: a method 

*coding* is not even half of the story

*debugging* requires deep understanding of 

- the computational problem at hand
- the data
- the tools (Python)

*maintaining* also takes time

. . .

*Regression:* it used to work but not anymore

---

Git supports collaboration in software

the codebase is centralised and receives contributions

one can *branch* a codebase to develop and test ideas.

---

## Main commands

```bash
git create myrepo
```

```bash
git clone mycompanyrepo
```

More than one copy of the repo can be cloned in different parts of the same computer


```bash
git brach mycompanyrepo
```

---

```bash
git pull
```

reads a 'secret' `.git` folder inside the top folder of the repo

---

```bash
git add newfile.py
```

from now on, also `newfile.py` will be versioned

```bash
git status
```

what has been changed since the last version?

---

## The key commands

```bash
git commit -m "This is what I did: cleaned some code and added newfile.py"
```

cristallises a new version

---

```bash
git push
```

update the codebase to my current version 

To protect the codebase, destructive updates are treated by creating a branch

```bash
git merge
```

Proceed with caution...


# GitHub

---

## GitHub

A cloud platform to support collaborative coding

in principle, all code is public

We can clone, make changes, commit them in our local repository then send a *pull request* to the owner of the repo for our changes to be incorporated.

. . .

Knowing Git/GH is a critical skill today

A GH *portfolio* speak for our skills


# GitHub Classroom

---

GH Classroom helps learning by

- distributing coding assignments
- managing student repositories automatically
- providing feedback through GitHub
- tracking progress

---

## The GH Classroom workflow

1. instructor creates an assignment
2. student receives an invitation link
3. s. accept the assignment → GitHub auto-creates his/her own repo
4. s. clones the repo and work on it
5. s. pushes their changes (the submission)
6. i. reviews work on GitHub

---

Try the starter course:

```bash 
git clone https://github.com/sps-unimi-it/github-starter-course
```

# For reference: student instructions

---

The following material is from the GitHub Classroom admin pages

---

## Accepting an Assignment

instructor will share a link like:

`https://github.com/sps-unimi-it/c4css-2025-26`

when student clicks, it:

1. authorizes GitHub Classroom (first time only)
2. accepts the assignment
3. creates a personal repo on GH classroom

The repo name is usually: `c4css-2025-26-yourGitHubUsername`

---

## First steps

After accepting, you'll see a repository URL:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sps-unimi-it/c4css-2025-26-yourname.git

cd c4css-2025-yourname
```

The repository contains:

- Assignment instructions (usually in README.md)
- Starter code or templates
- Test files (sometimes)

---

## Working on Your Assignment

You already know how to:

- `git clone` - get the repository, *una tantum*
  
- `git pull` - get updates from instructors

Now you'll work locally, editing files in your favorite editor or IDE.

---

## Saving Your Work: The Git Workflow

To submit your work, you need to send your changes back to GitHub.

This involves three new commands:

1. `add` - Stage your changes
2. `commit` - Save a snapshot with a message
3. `push` - Send commits to GitHub


---

## Step 1: `git add`

selecting files to be included the next save point.

```bash
# Add a specific file
git add homework.ipynb
```

```bash
# Add a specific file
git add homework.ipynb

# Add all changed files
git add .

# or
git add --all
```

`git status` shows what's staged and what's not.

---

## Step 2: `git commit`

A commit is like a save point in a game - it records your changes with a descriptive message.

```bash
git commit -m "Complete question 1 and 2"
```

The message should briefly describe what you changed.

**Good messages:**

- "Fix bug in calculation function"
- "Add solutions for problems 3-5"

**Meh messages:**

- "stuff"
- "changes"

---

## Step 3: `git push`

This uploads your commits from your computer to GitHub.

```bash
git push
```

That's it: the new version now visible to the instructors

**N.B.** submitting = the last push before the deadline

---

## Complete Workflow Example

```bash
# Make changes to your files in your editor
# Then in terminal:

git status                    # See what changed
git add solution.py          # Stage the file
git commit -m "Add solution to problem 1"
git push                     # Upload to GitHub

# Continue working...
git add tests.py readme.md
git commit -m "Add tests and update readme"
git push
```

---

## Best Practices

**Commit Often**
- Make small, logical commits
- Don't wait until everything is done

**Push Regularly**
- Backup your work to GitHub
- Avoid last-minute technical issues

**Write Clear Messages**
- Helps you track your progress
- Helps instructors understand your work

---

## Common Scenarios

**Getting instructor updates:**

```bash
git pull
```

**Made changes but want to see status:**

```bash
git status
```

**Forgot to push before deadline?**

- commits are timestamped locally

- push ASAP and notify instructors

---

## Troubleshooting Tips

**"Your branch is behind..."**
- Someone else pushed changes
- Run `git pull` first, then push

**Forgot to commit?**
- Your changes are local only
- `git add` and commit before pushing

**Need help?**
- Check `git status` for hints
- Ask your instructor or TA
- GitHub Classroom interface shows submission status

---

## Viewing Your Submission

After pushing, visit your repository on GitHub:

`https://github.com/sps-unimi-it/c4css-2025-26-yourname.git`

- see all your files and chronology of commits

- check the timestamp of your last push

- read instructors' feedback (in Issues or PR comments)

---

## Deadlines and Submissions

**Key points:**

- your latest push before the deadline = your submission
- all commits are timestamped
- you can push updates until the deadline
- for simple tasks there is auto-grading (instant feedback)

---

## Quick Reference

```bash
# Get the assignment
git clone <repo-url>

# Check status
git status

# Save and submit workflow
git add <files>
git commit -m "descriptive message"
git push

# Get updates
git pull
```
