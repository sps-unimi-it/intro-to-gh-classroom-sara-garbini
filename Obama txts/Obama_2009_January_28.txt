It is a priority of my administration to make sure that the doors of this White House are open to all of our citizens, and that our government is open and honest and that the American people are heard. David and Sean, along with Cecilia Munoz and the rest of the team, will work to ensure that our administration is working closely with state and local officials elected by the American people. We believe a strong partnership between government at all levels is the best way to bring change to American families and to provide the leadership the American people deserve. I am happy to welcome them to our team.
